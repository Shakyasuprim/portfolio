            <h3>Project 1: First Web Development Project</h3>
            <p>
                This was my first project where I started learning the basics of web development using HTML and CSS.
                The main objective of this project was to understand how websites are structured and how content is displayed
                on the browser. I learned about HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.
                This project helped me understand the importance of semantic HTML and clean structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project, I also explored CSS for the first time. I learned how to apply colors, fonts, spacing,
                and layout styles to make a website visually appealing. I experimented with margins, padding, borders,
                and basic positioning. Although the design was simple, it gave me confidence and motivation to continue learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this project was a strong foundation for my journey in web development. It helped me understand
                how small changes in code can impact the appearance of a website and encouraged me to build more projects
                in the future.

            <h3>Project 2: Personal Information Website</h3>
            <p>
                The second project focused on creating a multi-section personal information website.
                In this project, I organized content into different sections such as About, Education,
                Skills, and Contact. This helped me understand how to structure a webpage properly and
                improve readability for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent more time improving the design using CSS. I learned how to use class selectors,
                style multiple elements consistently, and create a clean layout.
                I also focused on responsiveness by using relative units and simple layout techniques
                to ensure the website looks good on different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project improved my confidence in writing HTML and CSS without external help.
                It taught me the importance of user experience, clean design, and content organization.
                It also encouraged me to think like a developer rather than just writing code.
            </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 3: Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p>
                The third project is a portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, education,
                and projects in a professional manner. The goal was to create a simple but effective
                personal portfolio that could be shared with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, I focused on clean layout, consistent color themes, and readable typography.
                I structured the website using sections and reused CSS styles to maintain consistency.
                This project helped me understand how real-world portfolios are designed and structured.
            </p>
            <p>
                This portfolio project represents my growth as a beginner web developer.
                It combines everything I have learned so far and motivates me to keep improving my skills.
                In the future, I plan to enhance this portfolio with more projects and advanced features.
